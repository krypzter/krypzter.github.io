				<p class="lead">As the only player ever to have scored in an FA cup final, a League cup final, a UEFA cup final and a Champion's league final, the former captain of Liverpool FC and the England national team, Steven Gerrard is an inspiration to fans and footballers alike.</p>

				<p>On 24 November 2016, 36 year old Steven George Gerrard, MBE, called time on a remarkable career spanning eighteen years at the highest levels of football for club and country. He has won several awards including the Most valuable player in the Champions League in 2004-05 and PFA player of the year in 2006, ahead of Frank Lampard and Thierry Henry. In 2005 Gerrard won the Ballon d'Or (European Footballer of the Year) Bronze Award, and in December 2006 he became a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in recognition of his services to the game.</p>

				<p>There isn't much that hasn't already been said or written about this inspirational Captain who made a habit of performing miracles on the football pitch. A Scouser born and bred, Steven Gerrard was born on 30 May 1980 in Whiston, Merseyside. He was spotted by Liverpool, and joined the Liverpool Academy, at the age of nine while playing for his local Whiston team, Whiston Juniors, who he continued playing with until his final game as the captain of the under-12s team. Steven Gerrard not only captained the Whiston Juniors under-12s team, but also scored in the final and lifted the trophy in his final competition with the under-12s in Holland in 1992. Indeed, this was a glimpse of things to come.</p>

				<p>Archival footage of a young <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/watch-incredible-footage-young-steven-7456041" target="blank">Steven Gerrard playing for Whiston Juniors aged 12 years old (posted online by Melvyn Syder)</a> shows the early signs of what was to become his trademark long-range goal resembling his famous strike against Olympiakos on 8 December 2004. What made if even more fantastical was that it had only been a few weeks ago in September that a foot injury suffered in a league match against Manchester United saw Gerrard shelved until late November. Desperately trying to haul his side back from the brink of defeat, Steven Gerrard scored a stunning late goal as Liverpool came from behind to beat Olympiakos and go into knockout round of the 2005 Champions League.</p> 
				
				<blockquote>
					<p class="blockquote_paragraph"><em>"It may be predictable but, for me, the Olympiacos goal is the defining moment in Gerrard’s career. It was the template for what he would go on to do for Liverpool on numerous occasions: almost single-handedly dragging his team over the finishing line and snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Everything about it still makes me smile. The importance of the game at a heaving Anfield, the sense of magic of a European game under the floodlights, the desperation, the against-the-odds feel of the match, the strike – how he caught it, absolutely perfectly – and the commentary which has become myth as a former Bitter cannot hide his delight and incredulity. Stevie’s celebration was also something to witness."</em></p>

				<p class="lead">His <em>pièce de résistance,</em> however, was his heroics on that <strong><em>'Magical night in Istanbul'</em></strong> on 25 May 2005, that earnt him the title 'Captain Fantastic!'</p>

				<p>Every Liverpool fan remembers exactly where they were that day. For me, it was a cold winter morning, in Melbourne, Australia eagerly awaiting the Live telecast from Istanbul - Kickoff time: 4.45 AM Melbourne local time. Liverpool were three goals down at half-time, and looking dazed from the barrage of what must have felt like concussive blows everytime another goal was conceded. We had just been bamboozled by a Milan team that had left Liverpool reeling in their wake.</p>

				<p>But I remained resolute because after all, <strong>You Will Never Walk Alone</strong>. My team needed every one of its fans urging them on, as if those many thousands of crossed-fingers from around the world could somehow through sheer power of will change the outcome of the match. But we needn't have worried, because our Captain was at hand to rescue the crew of the <em>'Kobayashi Maru'.</em> He took a no-win scenario, sprinkled it with some magic dust, and wrote his name in Liverpool lore!</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p class="blockquote_paragraph"><em>"Not just his goal in Istanbul but the force of nature that inspired Liverpool back from the abyss. It was he who drove the team on to achieve the impossible."</em></p>
					<footer class="blockquote_footer">Chris Rowland, for Tomkins Times.</footer>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
					<p class="blockquote_paragraph"><em>"His (Steven Gerrard's) second goal in Cardiff is almost certainly, in terms of pure visceral rush, the greatest he ever scored, nudging out the ya-beauty belter against Olympiakos, his youthful surge in the 2001 Uefa Cup final, that astonishing half-volleyed curler against Middlesbrough, the famous heat-seeker against Manchester United. All of those were better than the header he scored in Istanbul. But none of them changed everything like the header in Istanbul.</em></p>
					<p class="blockquote_paragraph"><em>It was seismic. The header heard all around the world. All goals, by their very definition, change the balance of matches to some extent but this one was off the scale. It didn’t so much alter the mood as bend the mind.</em></p>
					<p class="blockquote_paragraph"><em>A good goal, if not a brilliant one, but that wasn’t really the point. The atmosphere at the Ataturk Stadium changed abruptly. Defiance, relief and hope. It was all of those things at once, sort of, and yet not really any of them either. No one could quite put their finger on what it was. Minds, you see, had been palpably warped. The doors of perception were banging open and shut as if from gusts of wind swirling through a haunted house. No one had a bloody clue. Least of all Milan."</em></p>
